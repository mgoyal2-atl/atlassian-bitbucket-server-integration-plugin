# Contains a list of fields that were *safely* removed. Safe removal involves doing an upgrade test to see that
# the class can be removed without breaking any jobs or other functionality.
# Very few fields should be listed in here, and once a release is made the field should be removed from here (or the test fails)
# Format is semi-colon separated string, with fully-justified field name
# fullClassName#fieldName;reason why it is safe to remove
